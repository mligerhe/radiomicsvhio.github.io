Francesco joined VHIO in 2020. His research aims to develop clinically-feasible Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) techniques for non-invasive liver cell size and density measurement. He is also involved in designing MRI acquisition/post-processing in clinical studies of the Radiomics Group.

### Scientific trajectory
Francesco is a biomedical engineer specialised in computational MRI, with almost 10 years of experience in MRI research. He graduated at the [University of Cagliari](https://www.unica.it/unica/en/homepage.page) (BEng Biomedical engineering, 2009) and [University of Genoa](https://unige.it/en) (MEng Bioengineering, 2012) in Italy, and then obtained a PhD at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) (UCL, UK) in Magnetic Resonance Physics (2016). He worked as a post-doc at UCL from 2016 to 2020, where he investigated ńew ways of acquiring and analysing diffusion MRI scans of the spinal cord for application in multiple sclerosis. He was elected Trainee representative (2018-2020) of the [International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine](https://www.ismrm.org/) (ISMRM) White Matter Study Group, and since October 2020 he senior post-doc at the [Vall d'Hebron Institute of Oncology](https://www.vhio.net/) (VHIO), where he works on body and abdominal MRI for precision medicine in cancer.
