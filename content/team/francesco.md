I am a biomedical engineer specialised in computational Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), with almost 10 years of experience in MRI research. I graduated at the [University of Cagliari](https://www.unica.it/unica/en/homepage.page) (BEng Biomedical engineering, 2009) and [University of Genoa](https://unige.it/en) (MEng Bioengineering, 2012) in Italy, and then obtained a PhD at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) (UCL) in Magnetic Resonance Physics (2016). I have worked as a post-doc at UCL from February 2016 to September 2020, where I was a member of the Queen Square Institute of Neurology and Centre for Medical Image Computing. I have been Trainee representative (2018-2020) of the White Matter Study Group of the [International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine](https://www.ismrm.org/) (ISMRM), of which I am a member since 2013. Since October 2020 I am a senior post-doc at the [Vall d'Hebron Institute of Oncology](https://www.vhio.net/) (VHIO), where I work on MRI development in cancer for precision medicine. My latest research at VHIO focusses on developing new, clinically-feasible MRI techniques for non-invasive measurement of cell size and density, which find application in liver imaging and in cell senescence detection. I also lead the design of MRI acquisition and analysis pipelines for the new prospective studies that are carried out by the Radiomics group.
