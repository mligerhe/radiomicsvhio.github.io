Marta is a biomedical engineer who joined the Radiomics group on 2018. Her research is focused onthe implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) for developing CT-radiomics based biomakers of response to immunotherapy. She has a research interest on improving immunotherapy predictive biomarkers by developing deep learning arquitectures capturing multi-lesion patients response. She also gives supports for developing CT-radiomics biomarkers in other oncological applications.

### Scientific trajectory 

Marta is a PhD student with expertise in image processing/quantification (Radiomics) and implementation of machine learning algorithms for medical imaging applications. 
She has computational skills in programming for image processing and data analysis with R and Python. 
Graduated in Biomedical Engineering (2017) from the University of Barcelona and Master of Science in Biomedical engineering (2018) from the Polytechnic University of Barcelona. 
She specialized in Medical Imaging during her final master thesis at Radiomics group from Vall d’Hebron Institute of Oncology (VHIO), developing Radiomics-based algorithms for response prediction in cancer patients.   
Currently working as a predoctoral researcher at the Vall d'Hebron Institute of Oncology (VHIO) since 2018, developing tools for response prediction to immunotherapy based on image quantification and associating them with biological data. The results of these studies has been presented in oral presentations at the European Congress of Radiology (M. Ligero, ECR 2020 Vienna, Austria) and ESMO Congress (M. Ligero, ESMO Congress 2019 Barcelona, Spain) and they have been also published (M. Ligero et. al, Radiology 2021). 
Moreover, reproducibility studies about image quantification techniques based on the acquisition and reconstruction of the computer tomography (CT) images has been developed and presented at the Engineering in Medicine and Biology Conference (M. Ligero EMB Conference 2019, Berlin, Germany) and the results of this analysis have been published (M. Ligero et. al, European Radiology 2020) 


### Open-source research software
He has released several open-source packages for advanced image analysis, e.g.:
* [MyRelax](https://github.com/fragrussu/MyRelax), for myelin and relaxation analysis in MRI;
