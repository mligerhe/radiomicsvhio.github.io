We provide expertise in engineering and bioinformatics for the development and clinical qualification of quantitative imaging biomarkers for precision medicine to improve outcomes for cancer patients. We integrate radiomics and genomics in translational studies towards a deeper understanding of tumor evolution and mechanisms of resistance to anti-cancer therapies.
